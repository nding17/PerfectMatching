# PerfectMatching

```
this is a small program I made to test out the 
perfect matching algorithm. 

details could be found in project_details.pdf
in order to check out the mathematical details
as well as how I implemented the algorithm. 

to run the program, simply run 
TestPerfectMatching.java under /src catelog

***
more details regarding running instructions:

in order to see whether the algorithm works
you can simply run TestPerfectMatching.java
if you want to try other graphs created by 
the author, you could simply tweak the 
comment and release other types of graphs.

to see the main algorithm, please refer to 
PerfectMatching.java first. This is where we
apply the greedy algorithm first to try to 
find as many matched nodes as possible.

Later on we will use depth first search (brute
force) to search all possible paths and find an
augmenting path as introduced by the textbook.
